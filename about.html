          The need for a technical club which would incorporate the principles
          of all engineering branches onto a common platform was felt by the
          dynamic students of the college, as a result of which the iter
          robotics club was initiated in the year 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
          ​It is an open club, co-ordinated by the students, functioning in the
          interest of students of the institution wishing to have a practical
          application of their knowledge base, gained from the classrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          ​We at iter robotics club constantly have been working for the
          spreading of technical awareness in the field of robotics .
        </p>
        <p>
          ​We beileve in creating local hotpots of technical knowledge for the
          proper access to technology to the engineering fraternity. We believe
          in putting theories into practice in day to day life making process
          easier for humans
        </p>
        <p>
          ​The worldwide developments in the field of robotics today has
          obviously encouraged whooping number of students taking ‘robotics’
          into something more than just a hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presently, the IRC has more than 100+ registered student members from
          various branches who have shown their excellence by winning robotics
          competitions throughout the nation.
